# raindrops


Repository for the raindrops project.
ren'py launch files not included.
Download their SDK to run.

**If you've opened the game prior to 2015-06-02, click the "Delete Persistent" button on the launcher.**


### Usage

You can download the current build of the game by downloading the ZIP file.

For easy updates, download the GitHub for Windows program, and click the "Clone in Desktop" button on the repository page. It should open up the GitHub client and prompt you to save in a local directory. Once that is completed, you can sync changes with a press of the "Sync" button once changes are uploaded.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository through a git-enabled shell such as Git Bash or MinGW for Windows or via terminal on Mac or Linux. I'm not too good with GitHub myself, so I assume you'd be able to figure out how to do this if you go for the terminal option. Once you've cloned the repository, the "git pull" command will pull all new changes.


### Debugging Options

Press "shift+O" to access the debug menu. From there, enter the command "jump" and a string representing the label you would like to jump to. Currently, we have three (3) scenes for Juni, including a scene 0 that acts as filler, and one (1) scene for Jase, which is filler. 

For instance, if you wanted to jump to Juni's second scene, type in "jump juni2". A list of Juni's scenes can be found by typing "juni_toc".

*EDIT:* I have added a Chapters button, which can be accessed from the main and pause menus. No need to open the console to jump around.

### Contributing

If you're on StudioSTORIAN and want to directly push via the repository, give Carlin or Patrick your GitHub username, and we can add you to the contributors. If you have questions, ask Patrick or search for help on Google or GitHub's help pages.
