Repository for the raindrops project.
ren'py launch files not included.
Download their SDK to run.

If you've opened the game prior to 2015-06-02, click the "Delete Persistent" button on the launcher.

Jumping instructions:
Press "shift+O" to access the debug menu. From there, enter the command "jump" and a string representing the label you would like to jump to. Currently, we have three (3) scenes for Juni, including a scene 0 that acts as filler, and one (1) scene for Jase, which is filler. 

For instance, if you wanted to jump to Juni's second scene, type in "jump juni2".
